## Lesson objective: Functions

### Aim: How can we use functions to help us write less code?

### Vocab:
* modifier
* return-type
* method-name
* parameter-list
* body

### Warm up
time: 10 min
setup: groups of 3
resource: computer, page of lyrics to a song with a repeating chorus that differs slightly each time
instructions: in your groups, write code to print out these song lyrics.

### Lesson Content
time: 15 minute
resource: slides
* vocab overview
* diagram of function and syntax broken down
* example of function that adds
* example of function that multiplies(label as foo) -ask students what they think this function does
* ask which is modifiers, which is return-type, which is name, what are parameters, body(come up and circle)
* Ask students to instruct me on a function to write and I'll demo it
* ask volunteer a student to try it out as well (just the function shell)
* review the function with class
* go into how functions help us
* show the function and code that could be used for the warm up song they did earlier
* ask pros and cons

### Lesson Activity
time: 25 min
* have them go back into groups and rewrite their code to use a function
* have them write some basic Functions
** mild: add, multiply, subtract, divide, greeting, exponent
** medium: have them write a function that converts temperature, one that converts time from standard to military
** spicy: have them write a function that does a math formula - this function has to call on other functions to do the basic math

### Closing
time: 5 min
* exit ticket: sheet of functions and have to identify the different parts fo each function
