I would set them up with giving a quick demo of how I would choose a model. How to set variables and start the model. I would then have them work in pairs and then pick any model. I would have them describe and observe what happens when which variables change. Are there any patterns? What do some of these changes mean in real life? I think allowing them to openly explore would help keep them interested , but providing the questions helps guide them enough to experience it.
